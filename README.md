# Description
A 3D project (with a 2D perspective) Unity game. The player moves left and right to avoid meteors for as long as they can. If the playerâ€™s ship 
gets hit by a meteor, the ship will explode, and the player will see how long they lasted (in seconds) and be asked if they would like to restart.
